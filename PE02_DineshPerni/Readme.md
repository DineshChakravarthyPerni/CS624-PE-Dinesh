Input
The program relies heavily on user interactions for its input.
User text input is recorded when they specify their preferred course in the available input area.
Furthermore, to run smoothly, the program requires the "icon.png" image file, which should be located in the "./assets" directory. 
These two inputs, namely the user's course selection and the image file, are essential for the program to function.

Process
The main purpose of the software is to present content on the screen in an organized manner. It leverages core components of React Native, such as View, Text, ScrollView, Image, and TextInput, to structure and display information. A functional component, represented by an arrow function, encapsulates the program's logic.

Output
The program generates a visually appealing and well-structured mobile app interface. It showcases a title, subtitle, a list of courses, links, and an input area for users to specify their preferred course. Furthermore, the program adheres to the specified style guidelines, encompassing aspects like font sizes, colors, and a scrollable layout, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, the program provides users with a link to access CityU's course catalog, enabling them to retrieve external data.
